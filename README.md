# IndependentDecentralizedMPGLearning

Official implementation for the paper "Independent and Decentralized Learning in Markov Potential Games" by Maheshwari et al.

Usage: `python reproduce_figures.py` produces all experiments which are run in the paper.
For more guidance on constructing your own experiments, read `reproduce_figures.py`, which shows you how to set up
an experiment, run the learning algorithm, and produce plots.
